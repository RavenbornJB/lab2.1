# Numbertasks
## Module for processing different types of numbers
### Basic stuff
Yeah, so you can do that. Process different numbers, sure.

Caprecar (I know), Leyland, Lischrel, and trimorph numbers.

Just clone the entire repository, everything is required.
___
### Example
```
>>> python numbertasks.py
Please enter a type of number (caprecar, leyland, lischrel, trimorph)
that you would like to analyze: caprecar
2223000
[]
```
That's pretty much it, nothing out of ordinary. The program terminates if you input something that doesn't match the proposed options.
